      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Fresh tomatoes and a rich, cheesy filling make a summertime savory pie.
        There is a lot of preparation for this pie, but it is well worth every
        minute. I love this pie on summer mountain evenings. Enjoy with cool ice
        tea.
      </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9-inch pie crust</li>
        <li>2 pounds heirloom tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 pound Roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup diced raw bacon</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced leek</li>
        <li>2 cups grated white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Fontina cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh basil, torn into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Chill pie dough for about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a baking
          sheet on the lower oven rack.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slice heirloom tomatoes into 1/2-inch rounds. Remove seeds with your
          fingers. Place 6 slices on paper towels or a clean cloth and cover
          with more paper towels or another clean cloth. Arrange the remaining
          slices on a wire rack. Cut Roma tomatoes into 1/2-inch slices, remove
          seeds, and arrange them on the rack as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line a deep-dish, 9-inch pie plate with dough. Place 2 layers of
          aluminum foil over the entire surface. Fill with pie weights or dried
          beans.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake pie crust on the preheated baking sheet on the bottom rack. Place
          tomatoes on a higher rack. Reduce temperature to 400 degrees F (200
          degrees C). Bake until the bottom of the pie crust has lost its
          translucent raw look and the edges have just started to color, 12 to
          15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully remove the foil and the weights. Cover the edges of the
          crust with foil to prevent them from burning. Poke the bottom of the
          pie crust with a fork to keep it from puffing up. Return the pie crust
          to the bottom rack and bake until the bottom starts to color, about 8
          more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove pie crust and allow to cool. Continue baking the tomatoes until
          they are wilted, about 40 minutes total. Remove and allow to cool.
          Keep the oven on.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
          occasionally, until some of the fat has rendered, about 5 minutes. Add
          sliced leek. Cook until bacon is crisp and the leeks have softened and
          browned, about 5 more minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels and allow
          to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place bacon-leek mixture, Cheddar, Fontina, mayonnaise, basil, egg,
          and mustard in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Mix to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread 1/3 mixture on the bottom of the pie crust. Arrange 1/2 of the
          roasted tomatoes on top, overlapping heirlooms with Roma tomatoes.
          Spread another 1/3 of the mixture over the tomatoes and arrange the
          remaining roasted tomatoes on top. Add the last 1/3 of the mixture and
          gently press the fresh tomato slices on top in a decorative pattern.
          Arrange foil around the edges of the pie crust to protect them from
          burning, taking care that the foil doesn't touch the tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake until browned and bubbly on top, about 40 minutes. Cool
          completely before serving.
        </li>
